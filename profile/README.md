## Hi there 👋

<!--

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)

We're Genesis Computing.

Our goal is to grant content creators the ability to own their own platforms to share their content under their own terms.
No more middlemen taking cuts dictated by obscured or hidden terms, conglomerates deciding how your content is shared and managed -
All this power should be put in the hands of the creator. And that's why we created [Gaia](<https://gaia.genesiscomputing.uk>).

## What is Gaia?

Gaia (/ˈɡeɪə, ˈɡaɪə/), meaning Earth, is a development toolkit for artists, visionaries, developers and other creators to share and upload content unto a blockchain. Whether you wish to sell your art, sign legal documents, create subscription models for services, manage game-world items or even track physical items in the real world, Gaia provides you with an extensive toolset to achieve anything you desire.
