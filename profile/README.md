# Galaxy Computing Limited

Our goal is to grant content creators the ability to own their own platforms to share their content under their own terms.
No more middlemen taking cuts dictated by obscured or hidden terms, conglomerates deciding how your content is shared and managed -
All this power should be put in the hands of the creator. And that's why we created [Gaia](<https://gaia.genesiscomputing.uk>).

## What is Gaia?

Gaia (/ËˆÉ¡eÉªÉ™, ËˆÉ¡aÉªÉ™/), meaning Earth, is a dynamic minter & development toolkit for artists, visionaries, developers and other creators to share and upload content on to any blockchain. (Yes, this means we have multi/cross chain support!) Whether you wish to sell your art, sign legal documents, create subscription models for services, manage game-world items or even track physical items in the real world, Gaia provides you with an extensive toolset to achieve anything you desire.

We offer a custom built developer console to manage your Gaia deployment, a React-based API for users to interact with the items in your Gaia deployment, a full cross-chain solution for users on other ecosystems and access to an expansive plugin system to enable you to extend the functionality of the content you wish for others to mint.

## Why does it matter?

In an age of content ownership being held by a select few powers, diminishing returns for creators wishing to succeed on their target platform, it beckons the question of how content distribution should be permitted.
Should a major label own your identity and soul for the promise of fame and wealth?
Should the terms and conditions for your posession of a product be obfuscated under small print?
With Gaia, you *are* the platform. *You* are the label, director, manager of what's *yours.*
And we're here to help you achieve that. ðŸ«€

## Get involved

We are always looking for more talented engineers, managers, lawyers and marketers to help achieve this dream.
We are not just looking for the most experienced or most qualified. We're looking for the critical thinkers, the driven engineers who take on the vision and push the idea further than it currently is.
If this sounds like you, shoot an email and work with us or feel free to start making pull requests!

The trick with is: take the initiative.
